1. Tokenizer: Breaks the string into tokens based on Nonterminal Expressions and Metacharacters
    example string with Nonterminal Expressions: "+", "*"
                        Metacharaters: ")", "("
    "(5+3)*8" -> "(", "5", "+", "3", ")", "*", "8"
2. Parser: Dispatches token and builds AST as a result

        <term>       ::= <factor> [ <mulop> <factor> ]*
