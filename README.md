# Design-Patterns

Motivation: One big development constant is Change. This begs the question: how to make good OO design decisions that make for a reusable, extensible and maintainable code?

This book teaches you just that, introducting 13 different design patterns: https://www.amazon.de/First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124

Some advantages of patterns:
 - show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.
 - allow for some part of the system to vary independently of all other parts
 - provides a shared language that can maximize the value of communication with other developers
